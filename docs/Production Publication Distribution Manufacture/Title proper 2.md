### Definition and scope

X.X A title of manifestation that is selected for preference in a specific application or context.

X.X An alternative title is treated as part of a title proper.


### Sources of information

X.X. The preferred source of information for the title proper is the title page. For special provisions relating to single-sheet manifestations, see CITATION.

X.X. Multipart monographs. If the volume is part of a multipart monograph, and the title page gives a statement of the volume or part number within the larger work, omit this statement without using the mark of omission, unless it is a grammatically inseparable part of the information being transcribed. Do transcribe statements such as “in two volumes,” however CITATION.

### Form and order of information

X.X Transcribe title information in the form and order in which it is presented in the source, unless instructed otherwise by specific guidelines CITATION.

X.X If parts of the title are scattered by layout or typography, compose the title proper based on those parts distinguished by position, typography, or size of lettering. If the text could reasonably be assembled in a different order, provide additional title access if considered important. 

```Our choice, Grover Cleveland, A.G. Thurman. Democratic nominees, for president, for vice president```

**Comment: Title assembled from words scattered on four banners, above and below the image**
Source: [Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/resource/cph.3a06060/)

X.X. If the title information is arranged decoratively, or other elements of the description (e.g., creator or publisher) are interspersed with the title information, determine the logical sequence and record the title in that order.

```The nursery frieze```

**Comment: Title constructed from letters scattered in sequence among the illustrations.**

## Words considered part of the title proper

X.X. Title information preceding the chief title on the title page is considered part of the title proper if it is grammatically inseparable from the chief title. If the chief title is preceded or followed in the source by other elements of information, transpose these elements to their appropriate elements in the description (or give them in a note) unless case endings would be affected, the grammatical construction of the information would be disturbed, or the text is otherwise grammatically inseparable from the title proper. In the latter cases, transcribe the information as part of the title proper.
